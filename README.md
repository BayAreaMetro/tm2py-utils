# tm2py-utils
Travel Model Two utilities, including post-processing, summaraziation and other utilities for tm2py.  
To Run tm2py the [Travel Model Two (tm2) repo](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/tm2py) for model running. 
* __Note:__ tm2py-utils was separated out to allow for a the usage of a wide variety of packages without affecting / breaking the main model. This allows for fast development of utilities with relative stability of the model.
* These resources should *not* depend on EMME; code that depends on EMME belongs in [tm2py](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/tm2py).

Subdirs will have their requirements.txt
