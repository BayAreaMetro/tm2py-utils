# Observed Data Processing Tools

This directory contains scripts for processing external observed data (ACS, surveys, etc.) to compare against model outputs.

## Files

- **process_acs_household_vehicle.py** - Processes American Community Survey (ACS) data for household vehicle ownership comparisons
- **convert_acs_data.py** - Converts raw ACS data files to model-comparable format

## Usage

These tools are used to prepare observed/survey data for validation comparisons. Run them separately before generating model summaries.

The processed outputs can then be compared against the model summaries generated by `summarize_model_run.py`.
