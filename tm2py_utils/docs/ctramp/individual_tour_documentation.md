# Individual Tour Generation and Scheduling Model

## Overview

The Individual Tour Generation and Scheduling Model determines the non-mandatory travel activities that individuals undertake independently, separate from mandatory activities (work/school) and household joint activities. This model captures personal discretionary travel behavior and individual activity participation patterns.

## Model Purpose

**Primary Function**: Generate individual tours for discretionary activities based on personal preferences, time availability, and household constraints after accounting for mandatory activities and joint household travel.

**Key Decisions**:

- Number and type of individual discretionary tours
- Activity purpose and priority scheduling  
- Timing coordination with mandatory activities
- Resource allocation between competing activities
- Independence vs. household coordination trade-offs

## Behavioral Foundation

### Individual Activity Theory

**Personal Utility Maximization**: Individuals seek to maximize satisfaction from discretionary activities subject to:

- **Time Budget Constraints**: Available time after mandatory activities
- **Resource Constraints**: Personal income, vehicle access, household responsibilities  
- **Energy and Attention**: Physical and mental capacity for additional activities
- **Social Preferences**: Desire for individual vs. social activities
- **Skill and Interest**: Capability and motivation for specific activities

**Activity Substitution and Complementarity**:

- **Substitutable Activities**: Shopping vs. online purchasing, entertainment alternatives
- **Complementary Activities**: Fitness and health services, hobby-related activities
- **Activity Chaining**: Efficient combination of multiple purposes in single tour
- **Temporal Flexibility**: Activities that can be rescheduled vs. time-specific activities

### Individual vs. Household Activity Allocation

**Personal Autonomy Factors**:

```text
Life Stage Independence:
- Teenagers: Increasing independence, peer influence
- Young Adults: Maximum individual autonomy  
- Parents: Individual time limited by family responsibilities
- Seniors: Renewed individual freedom, possible mobility constraints

Employment Effects:
- Work Schedule Flexibility: Individual time availability patterns
- Work-Related Stress: Need for individual relaxation and recreation
- Professional Networks: Work-related social and business activities
- Travel Benefits: Employer transportation subsidies and parking
```

**Household Context Integration**:

- Available individual time after joint household activities
- Personal vehicle access and priority within household
- Individual budget allocation within household finances
- Coordination to avoid activity conflicts with other members
