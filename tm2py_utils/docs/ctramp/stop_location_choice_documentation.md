# Stop Location Choice Model

## Overview

The Stop Location Choice Model determines the specific locations for intermediate stops that occur during tours, building upon the Stop Frequency Model's determination of how many stops to make. This model captures the spatial decision-making for trip chaining activities and the geographic optimization of multi-purpose travel.

## Model Purpose

**Primary Function**: Select optimal geographic locations for intermediate stops within tours, balancing activity needs, spatial efficiency, and transportation constraints.

**Key Decisions**:

- Specific zone location for each intermediate stop
- Spatial sequencing and routing optimization
- Activity clustering vs. spatial distribution trade-offs
- Route deviation acceptability for activity access
- Multi-purpose destination coordination

## Behavioral Foundation

### Spatial Efficiency in Trip Chaining

**Route Optimization Principles**: Travelers select stop locations to minimize total travel burden while maximizing activity utility:

- **Spatial Clustering**: Grouping activities in close geographic proximity
- **Route Efficiency**: Minimizing backtracking and out-of-direction travel
- **Activity Accessibility**: Ensuring reasonable access to desired activity types
- **Time Budget Management**: Balancing travel time with activity participation time
- **Mode Compatibility**: Selecting locations compatible with chosen tour mode

**Stop Location Hierarchy**:

```text
Primary Activity Location: Main tour destination (predetermined)
↓
Secondary Activity Locations: Intermediate stops (modeled choice)
↓
Spatial Relationship: Stop locations relative to home and primary destination

Spatial Patterns:
1. En Route Stops: Activities along or near direct travel path
2. Cluster Stops: Activities clustered near primary destination  
3. Origin Cluster: Activities clustered near home location
4. Detour Stops: Activities requiring route deviation for specific benefits
```

### Activity-Location Matching

**Activity-Specific Location Requirements**:
