# School Location Choice Model

## Overview

The School Location Choice Model determines which specific schools students attend, considering educational quality, accessibility, household preferences, and policy constraints. This specialized destination choice model captures the unique characteristics of school selection decisions that differ significantly from other activity location choices.

## Model Purpose

**Primary Function**: Select optimal school locations for students based on educational quality, transportation accessibility, household preferences, and enrollment policies.

**Key Decisions**:

- Specific school selection from available alternatives
- Trade-offs between school quality and transportation burden
- Public vs. private school choice considerations
- Specialized program access and educational matching
- Family coordination and sibling enrollment patterns

## Behavioral Foundation

### Educational Choice Theory

**School Selection Criteria**: Families choose schools to maximize educational utility considering:

- **Educational Quality**: Academic performance, programs, facilities, and reputation
- **Transportation Access**: Commute feasibility for students and families
- **Social Factors**: Peer groups, cultural fit, and community connections
- **Family Resources**: Tuition costs, transportation costs, and time investments
- **Policy Constraints**: Enrollment boundaries, admission requirements, and capacity limits

**Household Educational Investment Model**:

```text
Educational Investment Framework:
Families invest in education through school choice, considering:
- Long-term educational and career benefits for children
- Family financial resources and education budget allocation
- Sibling coordination and household efficiency considerations
- Cultural values and educational philosophy alignment

Utility Maximization:
School_Utility = Educational_Benefits - Transportation_Costs - 
                Monetary_Costs - Coordination_Complexity

Where benefits are long-term and costs are immediate daily burdens
```

### School Choice vs. General Destination Choice

**Unique School Choice Characteristics**:

**Long-term Commitment**: Schools represent multi-year decisions with high switching costs
**Policy Constraints**: Enrollment boundaries, admission requirements, and capacity limits
**Family Coordination**: Multiple children and household member coordination requirements
**Quality Emphasis**: Educational outcomes prioritized over convenience factors
**Social Networks**: Peer groups and community connections affecting choice

**Different from Other Destinations**:
- **Frequency**: Daily, mandatory attendance vs. discretionary activity participation
- **Duration**: Multi-hour daily commitment vs. variable activity duration  
- **Flexibility**: Limited choice set vs. wide destination alternatives
- **Coordination**: Family-wide impacts vs. individual activity decisions
