# Tour Destination Choice Model

## Overview

The Tour Destination Choice Model determines where individuals travel for their activities, selecting specific geographic locations that best satisfy their activity needs while considering travel costs, accessibility, and personal preferences. This model is fundamental to understanding spatial travel patterns and the relationship between land use and transportation demand.

## Model Purpose

**Primary Function**: Select optimal destination zones for tours based on activity requirements, transportation accessibility, land use characteristics, and individual preferences.

**Key Decisions**:

- Geographic location for primary tour activity
- Trade-offs between activity quality and transportation costs
- Spatial clustering effects and agglomeration benefits
- Accessibility vs. proximity optimization
- Competition among alternative destinations

## Behavioral Foundation

### Spatial Choice Theory

**Utility Maximization in Space**: Individuals choose destinations that maximize utility considering:

- **Activity Utility**: Quality, variety, and suitability of opportunities at destination
- **Transportation Costs**: Time, monetary cost, and effort required to reach destination
- **Familiarity**: Previous experience and knowledge of destination characteristics
- **Accessibility**: Ease of reaching destination by available transportation modes
- **Complementary Opportunities**: Other activities available at or near destination

**Distance Decay and Gravity Effects**:

```text
Fundamental Relationship:
Utility decreases with distance due to:
- Increased travel time and cost
- Reduced familiarity with distant locations
- Higher uncertainty about distant opportunities
- Physical and mental effort of longer trips

Gravity Model Foundation:
Attraction = f(Size, Quality) / f(Distance, Cost)

Where:
- Size = Amount of activity opportunity (employment, retail, services)
- Quality = Attractiveness and suitability of opportunities
- Distance = Geographic separation and travel impedance
- Cost = Generalized cost including time, money, and effort
```

### Activity-Specific Destination Requirements

**Work Destinations**:

- **Employment Opportunities**: Job availability and industry clustering
- **Wage Levels**: Income potential and career advancement opportunities  
- **Accessibility**: Commute feasibility by available transportation modes
- **Workplace Amenities**: Parking, transit access, nearby services
- **Professional Networks**: Industry agglomeration and networking benefits

**Shopping Destinations**:

- **Retail Variety**: Product selection and store type diversity
- **Price Competition**: Cost advantages and bargain opportunities
- **Convenience**: Parking availability, store hours, service quality
- **Complementary Services**: Banking, dining, entertainment co-location
- **Shopping Environment**: Safety, comfort, and aesthetic appeal

**Social/Recreation Destinations**:

- **Activity Quality**: Facilities, programs, and entertainment options
- **Social Networks**: Friends, family, and community connections
- **Cultural Amenities**: Restaurants, arts, entertainment, and cultural facilities
- **Natural Environment**: Parks, recreation areas, scenic qualities
- **Event Programming**: Scheduled activities and special events

## Model Structure and Specification

### Destination Choice Framework

**Multinomial Logit Structure**:

```text
P(destination_j) = exp(V_j + ε_j) / Σ[exp(V_k + ε_k)] for all destinations k

Where:
V_j = Systematic utility of destination j
ε_j = Random error term capturing unobserved destination attributes

Systematic Utility Components:
V_j = β_accessibility * Accessibility_j +
      β_size * Activity_Size_j +
      β_quality * Activity_Quality_j +  
      β_competition * Competition_j +
      β_demographics * Person_Destination_Match_j +
      β_land_use * Land_Use_Mix_j
```

### Core Utility Variables

**Transportation Accessibility**:

```text
Mode-Specific Accessibility:
Auto_Access_j = f(travel_time_auto, parking_cost, traffic_congestion)
Transit_Access_j = f(travel_time_transit, fare_cost, service_frequency, transfers)
Walk_Access_j = f(walk_time, pedestrian_infrastructure, safety)
Bike_Access_j = f(bike_time, cycling_infrastructure, topography, weather)

Composite Accessibility:
Accessibility_j = log(Σ[exp(β_mode * LOS_mode_j)]) for available modes

This logsum captures:
- Multi-modal accessibility benefits
- Mode choice flexibility at destination
- Transportation system performance effects
- Infrastructure quality impacts
```

**Activity Opportunity Size**:

```text
Employment Destinations:
Size_j = Total_Jobs_j * Industry_Match_Factor +
         Wage_Premium_j * Income_Attraction +
         Career_Advancement_Opportunities_j

Shopping Destinations:  
Size_j = Retail_Floor_Space_j * Store_Type_Relevance +
         Service_Establishments_j * Service_Match_Factor +
         Regional_Draw_Factor_j

Social/Recreation Destinations:
Size_j = Recreation_Facilities_j * Activity_Type_Match +
         Cultural_Amenities_j * Interest_Compatibility +
         Social_Network_Connections_j
```

**Destination Quality Indicators**:

```text
Quality Measures:
- Service quality ratings and reputation
- Facility condition and amenities
- Customer satisfaction and reviews
- Safety and security characteristics
- Environmental quality and aesthetics

Quality_j = β_service * Service_Rating_j +
