# Trip Mode Choice Model

## Overview

The Trip Mode Choice Model determines the transportation mode for individual trip segments within tours, building upon the tour-level mode decisions by allowing mode changes during intermediate stops. This model captures the flexibility and complexity of mixed-mode travel patterns and the optimization of transportation choices for specific trip segments.

## Model Purpose

**Primary Function**: Select optimal transportation modes for individual trip legs within tours, allowing for mode changes at intermediate stops and optimizing mode choice for specific trip characteristics.

**Key Decisions**:

- Mode choice for each trip segment within multi-stop tours
- Mode change decisions at intermediate activity locations  
- Tour mode constraint vs. trip-level optimization trade-offs
- Access/egress mode coordination for complex travel patterns
- Vehicle availability and mode accessibility throughout tour

## Behavioral Foundation

### Trip-Level vs. Tour-Level Mode Choice

**Hierarchical Mode Decision Framework**:

```text
Tour Mode Choice (Primary Decision):
- Overall tour transportation strategy and primary mode
- Vehicle allocation and major mode commitment
- Long-distance travel and primary accessibility mode
- Resource commitment and transportation planning level

Trip Mode Choice (Secondary Decision):
- Segment-specific optimization within tour mode constraints
- Local accessibility and short-distance mode flexibility
- Activity-specific mode requirements and preferences
- Opportunistic mode switching and efficiency optimization
```

**Mode Change Opportunities and Constraints**:

**Tour Mode Flexibility Levels**:

```text
High Flexibility Tours:
- Transit + Walking: Mode changes at every transit stop
- Park & Ride: Auto + Transit with mode change at parking location
- Mixed Mode: Planned mode changes for different tour segments

Medium Flexibility Tours:
- Auto Primary: Walking for short segments at destinations
- Transit Primary: Walking/cycling for local access/egress

Low Flexibility Tours:
- Drive Alone: Auto for entire tour with minimal mode change
- Long-Distance: Single mode due to distance and time constraints
```

### Trip-Specific Mode Optimization

**Segment-Level Mode Choice Factors**:

**Distance and Time Considerations**:
- Very short trips (< 0.5 miles): Walking preferred despite tour mode
- Short trips (0.5-2 miles): Cycling or short auto trips feasible
- Medium trips (2-10 miles): Tour mode typically maintained
- Long trips (10+ miles): Tour mode dominates due to efficiency

**Activity-Specific Mode Requirements**:
- **Cargo Transport**: Auto required for bulky purchases during shopping tours
- **Business Meetings**: Professional appearance favoring auto or comfortable transit
- **Social Activities**: Group coordination affecting mode choice flexibility
- **Personal Services**: Appointment timing requiring reliable transportation

**Local Infrastructure and Accessibility**:
- **Pedestrian Environment**: Safe, attractive walking enabling mode switches
- **Cycling Infrastructure**: Protected bike facilities supporting bike segments
- **Parking Availability**: Auto segment feasibility based on destination parking
- **Transit Connectivity**: Local transit enabling mode changes within tour

## Model Structure and Framework

### Conditional Mode Choice Structure

**Tour Mode Conditioning Framework**:

```text
P(Trip_Mode_j | Tour_Mode_k) = exp(V_j|k) / Σ[exp(V_i|k)] for available modes i

Where:
V_j|k = Conditional utility of trip mode j given tour mode k
Available modes depend on tour mode constraints and local opportunities

Tour Mode Constraints:
- Auto Tour: Auto, Walk available; Transit if park-and-ride location
- Transit Tour: Transit, Walk available; Bike if bike-and-ride facilities  
- Walk/Bike Tour: Walk, Bike available; Transit if good connectivity
- Mixed Tour: All modes available with coordination requirements
```
