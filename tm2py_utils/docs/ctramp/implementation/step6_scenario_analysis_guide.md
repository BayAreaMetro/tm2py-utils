update_highway_skims.py --network modified_highway.xml --time_periods peak,offpeak

# Implementation steps:
# 1. Modify highway network coding with capacity changes
# 2. Re-run traffic assignment to generate new travel times

2. Modify cost matrices
   - Add pricing costs to highway skims by time period
   - Consider exemptions (HOV, clean vehicles, resident discounts)
   - Update parking costs if coordinated pricing policy

3. Model behavioral responses
   - Mode shift from pricing (auto to transit, carpooling)
   - Route choice changes and traffic diversion  
   - Time-of-day shifts and peak spreading
   - Long-term destination and residential location changes
```
