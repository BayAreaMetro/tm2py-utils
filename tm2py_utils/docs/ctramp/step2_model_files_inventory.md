## File Size Distribution

- Total size: 4.9 MB
- Average size: 0.16 MB
- Large files (>5MB): 0



## Next Steps for Implementation Analysis

Based on this inventory, the following files should be prioritized for detailed analysis:

1. **High UEC Content Files** - Files with multiple UEC sheets
2. **Core Model Components** - Population synthesis, tour generation, mode choice
3. **Calibration Files** - Files containing model parameters and constants
4. **Network Files** - Transportation network and accessibility data
5. **Validation Files** - Model validation targets and observed data

## Step 3 Preparation

Key directories and file types identified for Java code analysis:
- UEC files → Java UEC processors and model classes
- Calibration files → Parameter loading and model initialization
- Network files → Network data processing and accessibility calculation
- Output files → Results generation and validation procedures
