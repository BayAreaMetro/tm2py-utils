# TravTravel Model Two, currently under development, is an important extension of Travel Model One. Fundamental to the foundation of Travel Model Two is the use of a wide ranging set of on-board transit rider surveys as well as the California Household travel survey, which obtained a statistical larger sample in the nine-county Bay Area.

Travel Model Two runs with a ***CTRAMP household demand model*** and ***EMME skimming/assignment*** procedures.🚶‍♀️

## Changes from Travel Model One 🎉

Important travel behavior enhancements in Travel Model Two include:

* A much more detailed spatial representation of transportation system supply including an accurate all-streets network for entire 9-county Bay Area, pedestrian paths\sidewalks from OpenStreetMap, bicycle facilities from MTC's BikeMapper, and transit networks from MTC's RTD network 🗺️
* Land-use and demographic forecast integration with [Bay Area UrbanSim Two](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/bayarea_urbansim) represented at a 40,000 micro-analysis zone (MAZ) level 🏙️
* Detailed transit access/egress based on actual origin/destinations at the MAZ level considering boarding and alighting at specific transit stops allowing for a more accurate representation of walk times 🚌
* More detailed temporal resolution using half-hourly time windows compared to hourly time windows in Travel Model One ⏰
* The effects of transit capacity and crowding 👥
* More detailed auto assignments, most notably with the loading of short trips to local streets 🛣️
* The inclusion of Taxis and Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) such as Uber and Lyft as a mode choice option 🚕
* Representation of Automated Vehicles 🤖

## Versions 🍰

* **TM2.0**: Initial TM2 with Cube, CTRAMP core, 3-zone system. In use by TAM (Marin) 🥧
* **TM2.1**: TM2 with transit CCR implemented in Emme (uses Cube and Emme), CTRAMP core. Anticipated release: Summer 2022. This work is being performed in the branch [transit-ccr](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/travel-model-two/tree/transit-ccr) 🧁
* **TM2.2**: TM2 with Emme only (not Cube). CTRAMP core. This work is being performed in the [tm2py repository](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/tm2py) -- **these docs are for this version** 🍰
* **TM2.3**: TM2 with Emme only and ActivitySim core. 🎂
