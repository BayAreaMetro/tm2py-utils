# Transit Network ðŸšŒ

The transit network is made up of three core components: transit lines, transit modes, and transit fares. The transit lines were built GTFS feeds from around 2015. The lines are coded with a mode (see below) and serve a series of stop nodes. Transit fares are coded according to Cube's Public Transport program (see below).

Transit trips are assigned between transit access points (TAPs), which represent individual or collections of transit stops for transit access/egress. TAPs are essentially transit specific TAZs that are automatically coded based on the transit network. See the [Level of Service Information](#level-of-service-information).

## Transit Modes

The following transit modes are defined based on the [Open511](https://511.org/developers/list/apis/) attributes (but not completely, since they came from the GTFS database predecessor, the Regional Transit Database). These modes represent combinations of operators and technology.

## Transit Fares

Transit fares are modeled in Cube's Public Transport (PT) program as follows:

1. Each transit mode is assigned a fare system in the Cube factor files
2. Each fare system is defined in the fares.far fare file
3. Each fare system is either FROMTO (fare zone based) or FLAT (initial + transfer in fare)
4. For FROMTO fare systems:
   1. Each stop node is assigned a FAREZONE ID in the master network
   2. The fare is looked up from the fare matrix (fareMatrix.txt), which is a text file with the following columns: MATRIX ZONE_I ZONE_J VALUE
   3. The fare to transfer in from other modes is defined via the FAREFROMFS array (of modes) in the fares.far file
5. For FLAT fare systems:
   1. The initial fare is defined via the IBOARDFARE in the fares.far file
   2. The fare to transfer in from other modes is defined via the FAREFROMFS array (of modes) in the fares.far file
