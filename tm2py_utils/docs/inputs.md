## Time Periods

Time periods in Travel Model Two are consistent with Travel Model One:

| Time Period | Times | Duration |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| EA (early AM) | 3 am to 6 am | 3 hours |
| AM (AM peak period) | 6 am to 10 am | 4 hours |
| MD (mid-day) | 10 am to 3 pm | 5 hours |
| PM (PM peak period) | 3 pm to 7 pm | 4 hours |

## Roadway Network

The all streets highway network, walk network, and bicycle network were developed from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/). The projection is [NAD 1983 StatePlane California VI FIPS 0406 Feet](https://epsg.io/2227).

### County Node Numbering System

The highway network uses a numbering system whereby each county has a reserved block of nodes. Within each county's block:

- Nodes 1 through 9,999 are reserved for TAZs
- Nodes 10,001 through 89,999 are for MAZs
- Nodes 90,001 through 99,999 are for transit access points (TAPs)

The blocks are assigned to the nine counties per MTC's numbering scheme, as shown in the table below.

Roadway, walk, bicycle, and transit network nodes are numbered by county as well and range from 1,000,000 to 10,000,000 as shown below.

| Code | County | TAZs | MAZs | TAPs | Network Node | HOV Lane Node |
|------|--------|------|------|------|--------------|----------------|
