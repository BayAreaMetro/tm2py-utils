=== TM2 Performance Monitor Script Instructions ===

2. Starting the Monitor
   a. Open PowerShell **as Administrator**.
   b. Change to the script directory:
        cd C:\Scripts
   c. Run:
        powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Setup-TravelModelMonitor.ps1 -StartImmediately
   d. You should see confirmation in the console. A new .blg (binary log) and .csv will be created
      in the output folder defined inside the script (by default: C:\PerfLogs\TM2-A).

3. Stopping the Monitor
   a. When you’re ready to stop (after your model run finishes), open PowerShell **as Administrator** again.
   b. Navigate to the same folder:
        cd C:\Scripts
   c. Run:
        powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\Setup-TravelModelMonitor.ps1 -Stop
   d. You’ll get a “stopped” message and the final .blg/.csv will be flushed to disk.

4. Viewing & Exporting Reports
   a. Launch **Performance Monitor** (perfmon.exe).
   b. Go to **File → Open…** and select the .blg file (e.g. C:\PerfLogs\TM2-A\DataCollector01.blg).
   c. To export CSV or HTML:
      - In PerfMon’s Action menu pick **Data → Export List…** (or use the toolbar).
      - Choose CSV or HTML and save it for sharing.

5. Real-time Inspection
   • You can open the .blg while it’s still writing; PerfMon will append new samples live.
   • Just repeat the “Open…” steps above and it will stream incoming data.

6. Tips
   • Always run PowerShell as Administrator or you’ll get permission errors.
   • If you don’t see output in C:\PerfLogs\TM2-A, check the script’s `$OutputPath` variable.
   • Rename old logs or move them to archive to avoid overwriting.
     ```

— Copy all of the above into a .txt file (e.g. “PerfMon-Instructions.txt”) and keep it handy for every model run. —
